Find the maximum sum possible from picking a contiguous subsequence of an array.

```[-1, 5, 6, -2, 20, -50, 4]```
What is the largest sum of contiguous elements available in this list?

In the example above, the maximum sum would be 29: ```[-1, 5, 6, -2, 20, -50, 4]```, because ```(5 + 6 - 2 + 20 = 29)```. End one element later and you'll go negative. Start one element earlier and you'll subtract one.
