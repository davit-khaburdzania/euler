change one word with another in whole text.

For Example:

	you have a text like this  "How I wish, how I wish you were here. 
				    We're just two lost souls 
				    Swimming in a fish bowl, 
				    Year after year, 
				    Running over the same old ground. 
				    What have we found? 
				    The same old fears. 
				    Wish you were here. "   //yeah, it's lyrics from Pink Floyd's song

your code have to change every 'wish' with any other word for example 'want' or 'dream'.
